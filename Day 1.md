# What is CSS? ü§î
![What is CSS ? - Importance of CSS in Website Designing - Best CSS Tutorial](https://www.techuptechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/what-is-css-use-of-css.jpeg)

Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as **CSS**, play a pivotal role in web development. They are an essential technology that empowers web developers to control the presentation and layout of web documents written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Let's delve into the significance and role of CSS in web development.

## Why CSS is Crucial üåê

Imagine a web page without CSS. It would be a plain and monotonous text document with no style, color, or layout. CSS steps in to transform this plain HTML into visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. Here's why CSS is crucial:

1.  **Separation of Concerns**: CSS allows the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (styling). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update websites.
    
2.  **Consistency**: CSS enables developers to maintain a consistent look and feel across a website. Changes to styles can be applied globally, ensuring uniformity.
    
3.  **Flexibility**: It gives developers fine-grained control over the appearance of HTML elements, making it possible to create diverse layouts and designs.
    
4.  **Responsive Design**: CSS is essential for building responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics.
    
5.  **Accessibility**: CSS allows developers to enhance web accessibility by defining styles for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
    

## CSS Example üåü

Let's consider a simple HTML paragraph element without any CSS:
``` html
<p>This is a plain HTML paragraph.</p>
```
Now, let's add some CSS to make it visually appealing:
``` css
p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #333;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    padding: 10px;
}
```
**In this example:**

-   `font-family` sets the typeface.
-   `font-size` determines the text size.
-   `color` defines the text color.
-   `background-color` sets the background color.
-   `padding` adds spacing around the paragraph.

By applying CSS, we've transformed a plain paragraph into a styled element that is easier to read and more visually appealing.

CSS is a vast and versatile language, offering numerous properties and techniques for web styling. As you progress in your CSS learning journey, you'll discover its power in creating stunning web designs. üé®‚ú®

In Day 2, we'll dive deeper into CSS syntax and selectors, building on this foundation to create even more impressive styles for your web pages. Stay tuned! üöÄüìö

# CSS Syntax and Selectors üé®
![CSS Syntax - Learn CSS](https://cdn.devdojo.com/guides/css/css-syntax-1469106898.png)

CSS syntax and selectors are the building blocks of styling web documents. In this section, we'll explore the core syntax of CSS rules and dive into various selectors that help us target specific HTML elements for styling. üåü

## CSS Syntax Basics

A CSS rule consists of a **selector**, followed by a pair of curly braces `{}` containing one or more **property-value pairs**. Here's the basic structure:
``` css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
-   **Selector**: This identifies the HTML element(s) you want to style.
-   **Property**: Specifies the style attribute you want to change.
-   **Value**: Assigns a value to the property.

Example:
``` css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```
In this example, we're targeting all `<h1>` elements and changing their color to blue and font size to 24 pixels.

## Common CSS Selectors

Selectors determine which HTML elements will be affected by your CSS rules. Here are some common selectors:

### 1. Element Selector

The element selector targets all instances of a specific HTML element. For example:
``` css
p {
    /* Styles applied to all <p> elements */
}
```
### 2. Class Selector

Class selectors target elements with a specific class attribute. You define the class in your HTML and then use it in your CSS. For example:
``` css
.my-class {
    /* Styles applied to elements with class="my-class" */
}
```
**HTML:**
``` html
<p class="my-class">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
```
### 3. ID Selector

ID selectors are used to target a single HTML element with a specific ID attribute. IDs should be unique within a page. For example:
``` html
#my-id {
    /* Styles applied to the element with id="my-id" */
}
```
**HTML:**
``` html
<div id="my-id">This is a styled div.</div>
```
### 4. Descendant Selector

You can target elements that are descendants of another element. For instance, if you want to style all paragraphs (`<p>`) inside a `<div>`, you can use the descendant selector:
``` css
div p {
    /* Styles applied to all <p> elements inside a <div> */
}
```
## Combining Selectors

You can combine selectors to target specific elements precisely. For instance, to style a paragraph with class `special` inside a `<div>` with ID `container`:
``` css
#container .special {
    /* Styles applied to <p> elements with class "special" inside #container */
}
```
## CSS Example üåü

Let's apply some of these concepts in a real-world example:
``` css
/* Element selector for all <p> elements */
p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
}

/* Class selector for elements with class "highlight" */
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* ID selector for an element with id "header" */
#header {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```
In this example, we've used element, class, and ID selectors to style different parts of a web page.

Understanding CSS syntax and selectors is essential as they form the foundation for creating beautifully styled web pages. In Day 3, we'll explore how to add CSS to HTML documents and see these selectors in action. Stay tuned! üöÄüéâ

# Adding CSS to HTML üåü
![How To Add CSS In HTML](https://f4n3x6c5.stackpathcdn.com/article/how-to-add-css-in-html/Images/WaysOfAddingCSS3.png)
Adding CSS to HTML is a fundamental step in web development, as it allows you to style your web pages and make them visually appealing. In this section, we'll explore three methods of adding CSS to HTML documents and provide detailed explanations with examples. Let's get started! üöÄüé®

## Inline CSS üßæ

**Inline CSS** is the simplest way to add styles to individual HTML elements. You apply styles directly to an element using the `style` attribute. Here's how it works:

``` html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a blue and larger text.</p
```
In this example, we've used the `style` attribute to set the text color to blue and the font size to 18 pixels for the `<p>` element. While inline CSS is straightforward, it's generally not recommended for styling entire web pages because it mixes HTML and CSS, making it harder to maintain and reuse styles.

## Internal CSS üìù

**Internal CSS** allows you to include your CSS styles within the `<style>` element in the HTML document's `<head>` section. This method is useful for styling a single HTML page or a group of related pages. Here's an example:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a green and larger text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, we've defined CSS rules within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. These styles apply to all `<p>` elements on the page. Internal CSS offers better organization compared to inline CSS but still mixes HTML and CSS.


In this example, we've defined CSS rules within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. These styles apply to all `<p>` elements on the page. Internal CSS offers better organization compared to inline CSS but still mixes HTML and CSS.

## External CSS üìÇ

**External CSS** is the most organized and scalable method for adding CSS to HTML. It involves creating a separate CSS file with a `.css` extension and linking it to your HTML document using the `<link>` element. This method is highly recommended for styling multiple pages consistently. Here's how it works:

**styles.css** (External CSS file):
``` css
/* styles.css */
p {
    color: purple;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```
**index.html** (HTML document):
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a purple and larger text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, we've created an external CSS file named `styles.css`, which contains the styling rules for `<p>` elements. We then linked this CSS file to the HTML document using the `<link>` element.

External CSS is the preferred method for maintaining and organizing styles in larger web projects. It promotes code reusability and separation of concerns by keeping HTML and CSS in separate files.

## Summary üìÑ

-   **Inline CSS** is added directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute, suitable for individual element styling.
-   **Internal CSS** is placed within the `<style>` element in the HTML `<head>` section, useful for styling a single page or a group of related pages.
-   **External CSS** involves creating a separate `.css` file and linking it to HTML documents using the `<link>` element, ideal for styling multiple pages consistently and maintaining code organization.

Choose the method that best suits your project's needs and complexity.

# Basic Styling and Properties üìä

## Text Properties üìù

### 1. `color` üåà

The `color` property sets the text color of an element. You can use color names, hexadecimal codes, RGB values, or HSL values to specify colors.

Example:
``` css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```
### 2. `font-family` üñãÔ∏è

The `font-family` property defines the typeface or font family for text. You can specify multiple font families as fallback options.

Example:
``` css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
### 3. `font-size` üìè

The `font-size` property determines the size of the text. You can use various units like pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), or percentages (`%`).

Example:
``` css
h1 {
    font-size: 36px;
}
```
## Background Properties üåÖ

### 4. `background-color` üé®

The `background-color` property sets the background color of an element. Like the `color` property, you can specify colors using various methods.

Example:
``` css
div {
    background-color: #FFD700; /* Gold */
}
```
## Spacing Properties üìä

### 5. `margin` and `padding` üìè

The `margin` property controls the spacing outside an element, while `padding` controls the spacing inside an element. You can set values for top, right, bottom, and left sides individually.

Example:
``` css
p {
    margin: 10px; /* Applies 10px margin on all sides */
    padding: 20px 10px; /* Applies 20px top and bottom, 10px left and right padding */
}
```
## Border Properties üß±

### 6. `border` üìÅ

The `border` property allows you to add borders around elements. You can specify the border style, color, and width.

Example:
``` css
button {
    border: 2px solid #333; /* 2px solid black border */
}
```
These are just a few of the basic CSS properties you can use to style your web pages. Experiment with different values and combinations to create visually appealing designs. As you progress in your CSS journey, you'll discover more properties and techniques to enhance your styling skills. Remember, practice makes perfect! üöÄüåü
